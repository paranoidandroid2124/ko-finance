# Phase 4 Plan — Polish, Performance & Accessibility

> Timebox: 2025-12-20 → 2025-12-31 · Owner: TBD · Status: Draft

## 1. Scope & Goals
- Harden UI/UX with accessibility, theming, and performance optimizations after feature completion.
- Address outstanding bugs from Phases 1–3 and ensure documentation/testing coverage is complete.
- Finalize release collateral (guides, changelog, demo walkthrough) for public beta.
- Out-of-scope: New feature development, major data model changes.

## 2. Deliverables
| Deliverable | Type | Target Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility audit report | Doc | design/accessibility_audit_phase4.md | WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checklist |
| Performance tuning patches | Code | Various (see issues) | Memoized charts, async suspense boundaries |
| Dark mode refinements | Component styling | web/dashboard/src/styles/theme.css | Ensure parity & color contrast |
| Reduced-motion fallback suite | Code/Stories | stories/MotionTokens.stories.tsx updates | Toggle and documentation |
| Release notes & demo script | Doc | design/phase4_release_notes.md | User-facing summary, upgrade guidance |
| Bug bash tracker | Doc | design/phase4_buglist.md | Issue status, owners, fixes |

## 3. Workstreams
### 3.1 Design / UX
- Run end-to-end UX review, catalog polish items, prioritize quick wins.
- Validate dark mode palette adjustments, ensure KPI contrast and lock messaging clarity.
- Prepare final screenshots/gifs for marketing and documentation.

### 3.2 Frontend Implementation
- Optimize hydration/lazy loading, leverage React suspense where appropriate.
- Implement reduced-motion fallbacks (disable shimmer, shorten animations) with runtime switch.
- Resolve outstanding layout bugs (responsive issues, overflow) discovered during QA.

### 3.3 Backend / Data
- Profile critical endpoints (search, snapshot, alerts) and tune indexes/caching.
- Ensure logging & monitoring dashboards capture new metrics (alerts, exports, RAG diffs).
- Run final data quality sweep (missing returns, reliability scores) and produce summary.

### 3.4 QA & Docs
- Execute full regression suite (automated + manual) with plan tier matrix.
- Conduct accessibility testing (keyboard, screen reader, contrast) and document findings.
- Compile release notes, migration steps, known issues for beta rollout.

## 4. Data Requirements
- Performance logs: esponse_time_ms, cache_hit, plan_tier context for each endpoint.
- Accessibility findings: track issues with severity and remediation owner.
- Bug tracker fields: component, severity, plan tier impact, fix version.

## 5. Plan Lock Mapping
| Feature | Free | Pro | Enterprise |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reduced-motion toggle | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Alert delivery logs | ✕ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Analytics dashboard | ✕ | ✕ | ✓ |
| Dark mode themes | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
- Scope creep from new feature requests → Mitigation: enforce freeze, triage to post-beta backlog.
- Accessibility regressions outside baseline → Mitigation: nightly axe checks, manual keyboard testing.
- Performance tuning causing regressions → Mitigation: benchmark before/after, add monitoring alerts.

## 7. Milestones & Checkpoints
| Milestone | Expected Date | Owner | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Accessibility audit complete | 2025-12-23 | QA/Design | Planned |
| Performance profiling report | 2025-12-24 | Engineering | Planned |
| Reduced-motion implementation | 2025-12-26 | Frontend | Planned |
| Bug bash & fixes | 2025-12-29 | Cross-functional | Planned |
| Release notes finalized | 2025-12-30 | Product | Planned |

## 8. QA Checklist
- Functional: no regressions on search, evidence, alerts across tiers.
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation, screen reader labels, contrast 4.5:1 (text) minimum.
- Performance: LCP < 2.5s (desktop), search P95 < 1.5s, alert firing < 2 min from trigger.
- Analytics/logging: ensure dashboards updated, alerts for failures configured.

## 9. Sign-offs
- Design | Product | Engineering | Compliance

- Notes: plan code freeze on 2025-12-27 with hotfix window through release date.
