# Phase 0 Deliverables Tracker

## Scope
- Information architecture & wireframes
- Motion/interaction token documentation
- Output to feed Phase 1 component build and Storybook setup

## Artifacts
| Artifact | Path | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| UX modernization wireframes | design/ux_modernization_wireframes.md | Draft | Screen-by-screen layout, data bindings, plan locks |
| Motion & interaction tokens | design/motion_tokens.md | Draft | Timing/easing/spatial tokens, implementation guidance |
| IA checklist | ops/long_term_must_do.md §1–3 | Reference | Source of data exposure requirements |

## Pending Actions
1. Produce low-fi sketches (paper/Figma) matching Section 1–5 of wireframes doc (attach export when ready).
2. Update design/ui_design_system.md to reference new motion tokens and plan lock patterns.
3. Create Storybook placeholder (stories/TokenPreview.stories.tsx) once Tailwind tokens exist.
4. Validate API field availability for newly surfaced KPIs (market returns, sector mapping, source reliability).

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Wireframe coverage aligns with all user journeys (search, company, filing, sector, chat).
- [ ] Motion tokens mapped to at least one component per interaction type.
- [ ] Plan lock UX documented for Free/Pro/Enterprise.
- [ ] Accessibility notes captured (reduce motion, keyboard).

## Sign-off
- Design review: _TBD_
- Product/PM approval: _TBD_
- Target completion for Phase 0: 2025-11-05
