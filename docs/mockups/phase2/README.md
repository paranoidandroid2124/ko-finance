# Phase 2 Mockups

Experimental assets for EvidencePanel v2 design exploration.

- Usage: embed in design discussions, Storybook documentation, or QA reviews only.
- Do **not** import these files in production bundles. They live under `docs/` to stay out of Next.js build targets.
- Keep exported artifacts light (PNG/GIF under 2MB) and include a short caption in the file name.
- Update this folder when the Phase 2 plan (`design/phase2_plan.md`) changes UX flows.
